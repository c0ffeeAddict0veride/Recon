<h1>Recon.sh</h1>
<text>Just a simple and easy bash script to use in your bug hunting this is a beta or as i like to call it version 1.0 enjoy :)</text>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<text>There is a lot of things that need to be installed of course for the script to work so use https://github.com/c0ffeeAddict0veride/reconinstall to install them and remember to have Python3 and Go installed
  on your terminal make sure to be running Linux this wont work on MacOS or CMD there may be errors i have used this on live targets before and it works fine 
  but if you do run into any errors it may be due to the installation process if not please make me aware thanks. :)
